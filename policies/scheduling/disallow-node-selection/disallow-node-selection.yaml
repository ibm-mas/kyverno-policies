      The Kubernetes scheduler uses complex logic to determine the optimal placement
      for new Pods. Users who have access to set certain fields in a Pod spec
      may sidestep this logic which in many cases is undesirable. This policy
      prevents users from targeting specific Nodes for scheduling of Pods by
      prohibiting the use of the `nodeSelector` and `nodeName` fields.
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  # The objective is to prevent the fields being assigned at creation time by a user,
  # however the scheduler will apply these fields when pods are assigned to a node
  # so background scanning must not be enabled for this policy
  background: false
